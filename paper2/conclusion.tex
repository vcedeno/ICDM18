\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This paper presents a parameter-free global summarization that creates optimal global summaries of discrete event signals patterns. We use the MDL principle to detect regularities and compress data. We apply two dynamic programming algorithms to optimally and automatically segment the sequences in time and cluster events to discover similarities in polynomial time. We generalize the generative model used for binary values event sequences for discrete values event sequences. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our summarization produces high-quality results with an automated global summary revealing regularities in the data. Future work includes temporal dynamic analysis for the model output; and to include spatio-temporal characteristics in the model.
